## Features
The Real-time Baby Monitor uses a combination of video and audio features extracted from the live feed to monitor the baby. These features are meticulously designed to detect specific behaviors and conditions such as crying, dangerous postures, potential suffocation, and apnea. Here are the specific features used:

| Detection Purpose          | Feature Name              | Calculation Method                                                                                                  | Meaning                                                                                             |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crying Detection           | Total Movement            | Sum of the Euclidean distances between KeyPoints in consecutive frames                                              | Captures overall movement of specific body parts in the video frame, indicative of the baby's liveliness when crying       |
|                            | Head Movement             | Euclidean distance between head positions in consecutive frames                               | Indicates movement of the baby's head, which may signal crying                                      |
|                            | Power Sum 2kHz to 4kHz    | Sum of the power of the audio signal in the 2kHz to 4kHz range                                                      | Represents frequencies indicative of crying sounds                                                  |
| Dangerous Posture Detection| Hand and Leg Movement     | Euclidean distance between hand and leg positions in consecutive frames                       | Detects movement of hands and legs, indicating climbing or standing attempts                        |
|                            | Body Length               | Euclidean distance between detected shoulder and hip positions                                                      | Measures body length to detect unusual or dangerous postures                                        |
|                            | Body Orientation          | Angle between detected shoulder and hip positions                                                                   | Assesses body orientation to detect unusual postures                                                |
| Suffocation and Apnea Detection | Nose Detected         | Binary feature indicating whether the nose was detected                                                             | Used to assess potential suffocation risks                                                          |
|                            | Chest and Abdomen Movement | Euclidean distance between chest and abdomen positions in consecutive frames                  | Monitors chest and abdomen movement, indicative of breathing; lack of movement may signal apnea     |
