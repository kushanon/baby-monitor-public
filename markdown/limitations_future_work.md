## Limitations and Future Work

Below is the current limitations of the Real-time Baby Monitor system and the corresponding future work to address these challenges. These limitations and future directions represent crucial steps towards the effective utilization and enhancement of the system.

| Limitation                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Future Work                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Single Feature Dependence for Anomaly Detection**    | <ul><li>The system uses individual features for anomaly detection, which may lead to false positives.</li><li>This simplistic approach might not capture the complexity of different situations like crying or dangerous postures.</li></ul> | **Combining Multiple Features for Anomaly Detection**  |Develop a more sophisticated anomaly detection algorithm that integrates multiple features. <ul><li>For example, a combined score could be calculated using the product of individual anomaly scores from different features such as movement data and audio analysis. This would allow for more accurate detection of specific behaviors like crying or climbing.</li></ul> |
| **Quality Dependence**                                 | <ul><li>The system's accuracy depends on the quality of the video and audio data.</li><li>Poor lighting or background noise can affect the results.</li></ul>                                                                   | N/A                                                    | N/A                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **IP Address Access Control**                          | Without implementing IP address access control, there is a risk of unauthorized access.                                                                                                                       | **Implementing Advanced Security Measures**            | Implement advanced security measures such as:<ul><li>IP Address Whitelisting</li><li>Robust authentication protocols</li><li>VPN access</li><li>Rate Limiting.</li></ul> |
| **Single Baby Support**                                | The system currently does not support multiple babies.                                                                                                                                                         | **Support for Multiple Babies**                        | Extend the system to support monitoring multiple babies simultaneously.                                                                               |
